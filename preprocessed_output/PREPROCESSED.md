# PREPROCESSED.md

This directory contains an example of how the preprocessed outputs such as the embeddings of the query, sentences, paragraphs along with cleaning (lemmatization, stopword removal and tokenization)

I have used the sample provided in "assets/sample/sample.txt" for the file used and "assets/sample/stopwords.txt" for the stopword dataset which contains around 700-800 stopwords.(source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rowhitswami/stopwords/data)
