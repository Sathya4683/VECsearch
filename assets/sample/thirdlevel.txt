The presidents of the New York Central and the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroads will swear on a stack of timetables that there are only two levels at Grand Central Station. But I say there are three, because I’ve been on the third level of the Grand Central Station. Of course, I took the obvious step — I talked to a psychiatrist friend of mine, among others. I told him about the third level, and he said it was a "waking-dream wish fulfillment." He claimed I was unhappy. That made my wife kind of mad, but he explained that what he meant was the modern world is full of insecurity, fear, war, worry, and all the rest of it — and I just wanted to escape.

Well, who doesn’t? Everybody I know wants to escape, but they don’t wander into a third level at Grand Central. That, he said, was the reason behind it. My friends agreed. They pointed to things like my stamp collecting as evidence — calling it a "temporary refuge from reality." Maybe so. But my grandfather didn’t need a refuge from reality; from all I hear, things were nice and peaceful in his time. He started my collection, in fact. It’s a nice collection — blocks of four of practically every U.S. issue, first-day covers, and so on. President Roosevelt collected stamps too, you know.

Anyway, here’s what happened at Grand Central. One night last summer, I worked late at the office. I was in a hurry to get uptown to my apartment, so I decided to take the subway from Grand Central because it’s faster than the bus. I don’t know why this happened to me — I’m just an ordinary guy named Charley, thirty-one years old. I was wearing a tan gabardine suit and a straw hat with a fancy band. I passed a dozen men who looked just like me. I wasn’t trying to escape from anything — I just wanted to get home to my wife, Louisa.

I entered Grand Central from Vanderbilt Avenue and went down the steps to the first level, where long-distance trains like the Twentieth Century leave. Then I went down another flight to the second level, where the suburban trains leave from. I ducked into an arched doorway heading for the subway — and got lost. That’s easy to do. I’ve been in and out of Grand Central hundreds of times, but I’m always bumping into new doorways, stairs, and corridors. Once, I ended up in a tunnel about a mile long and came out in the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel. Another time, I came up in an office building on Forty-sixth Street, three blocks away.

Sometimes, I think Grand Central is growing like a tree — pushing out new corridors and staircases like roots. Maybe there’s a long tunnel nobody knows about, feeling its way under the city toward Times Square, or even Central Park. And maybe, because so many people have used Grand Central as an exit — a way of escape — that’s how I got into the tunnel that led to the third level. But I never told my psychiatrist friend about that idea.

The corridor I found myself in began angling left and slanting downward. That felt wrong, but I kept walking. All I could hear was the empty sound of my footsteps, and I didn’t pass a single soul. Then I heard a hollow roar ahead — the kind that means open space and people. The tunnel turned sharply left; I went down a short flight of stairs and came out on the third level at Grand Central Station.

At first, I thought I was back on the second level, but I quickly realized this was different. The room was smaller, with fewer ticket windows and train gates. The information booth in the center was wooden and old-looking. The man inside wore a green eyeshade and long black sleeve protectors. The lights were dim and flickering. Then I saw why — they were open-flame gaslights. There were brass spittoons on the floor. Across the station, I noticed a man pulling a gold watch from his vest pocket. He snapped open the cover, glanced at the time, and frowned. He wore a derby hat, a black four-button suit with tiny lapels, and a big handlebar mustache.

I looked around. Everyone in the station was dressed like it was the 1890s. I saw more beards, sideburns, and fancy mustaches than I’d ever seen. A woman walked in wearing a dress with leg-of-mutton sleeves and skirts down to the tops of her high-buttoned shoes. Behind her, I glimpsed a small Currier & Ives-style locomotive with a funnel-shaped stack. That’s when I knew — I had somehow reached the year 1894.

To be sure, I walked over to a newsboy and glanced at the stack of papers at his feet. It was The World — a newspaper that hasn’t been published in years. The lead story mentioned President Cleveland. I later found that front page in the Public Library files — it was from June 11, 1894.

I turned toward the ticket windows, knowing I could buy tickets there that would take Louisa and me anywhere in the U.S. — in the year 1894. I wanted two tickets to Galesburg, Illinois. Have you ever been there? It’s a wonderful town even today, with big old frame houses, huge lawns, and trees whose branches meet overhead to roof the streets. In 1894, summer evenings were twice as long. People sat on their lawns — the men smoking cigars, the women waving fans — surrounded by fireflies, in a peaceful world. Back then, the First World War was still twenty years off, and the Second, over forty years away. I wanted those two tickets.

The clerk calculated the fare. He glanced at my fancy hatband but didn’t say anything. I had enough for two coach tickets, one way. But when I handed over the money, he stared at it and said, “That ain’t money, mister. And if you’re trying to skin me, you won’t get very far.” He looked toward the cash drawer. Of course, my bills were old-style — larger and different from what was used in 1894. I turned away quickly and got out. There’s nothing pleasant about jail, even in 1894.

And that was that. I must have left the same way I came. The next day, during lunch, I withdrew three hundred dollars from the bank — nearly all we had — and bought old-style currency from a coin dealer. That really worried my psychiatrist friend. You can buy old money at most coin shops, but it costs more. My $300 bought less than $200 worth of old bills. But I didn’t care. After all, eggs were thirteen cents a dozen in 1894.

But I’ve never again found the corridor that leads to the third level, though I’ve tried often. Louisa was worried when I told her, and she didn’t want me to keep looking. Eventually, I gave up and returned to my stamps. But now, we’re both looking again — every weekend — because we have proof that the third level is real.

My friend Sam Weiner disappeared. No one knew where, but I suspected. Sam was a city boy. I used to tell him about Galesburg — I went to school there — and he always said he liked the sound of it. And that’s where he is now — in 1894.

One night, while going through my stamp collection, I found a first-day cover that shouldn’t have been there. But there it was. Someone had mailed it to my grandfather in Galesburg. That’s what the envelope said, and the postmark showed it had been sent on July 18, 1894. The stamp was a six-cent dull brown with President Garfield’s picture. Naturally, when my grandfather got it, he added it to the collection and never opened it — until I did.

Inside, the paper wasn’t blank. It said:

941 Willard Street
Galesburg, Illinois
July 18, 1894

Charley,
I got to wishing that you were right. Then I got to believing you were right. And, Charley, it’s true; I found the third level! I’ve been here two weeks, and right now, down the street at the Daly’s, someone is playing a piano, and they’re all out on the front porch singing ‘Seeing Nelly Home.’ And I’m invited over for lemonade. Come on back, Charley and Louisa. Keep looking till you find the third level! It’s worth it, believe me!

— Sam

At the stamp and coin store I frequent, I found out that Sam bought eight hundred dollars’ worth of old-style currency. That should be enough to set him up in a nice little hay, feed, and grain business — something he always said he wanted. He certainly couldn’t return to his old job — not in Galesburg, Illinois, in 1894. His old job? Sam was my psychiatrist.
